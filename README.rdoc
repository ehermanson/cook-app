= Cook

This is a sample application I developed to help myself learn Ruby on Rails. It provides basic user sign-up/login functionality and nested forms for user submitted-recipes. Images are stored on Amazon S3. I'll be adding features to this app over time to continue learning Rails.

== DEMO

Cook is intended solely for demo purposes - but feel free to sign up and use it if you want a place to keep your recipes online!
